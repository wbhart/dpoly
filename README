This is a simple multivariate polynomial benchmark for the D programming language.

To compile it use the command:

ldc2 -O2 polytest.d bignum.d polynomial.d /usr/local/lib/libgmp.a

assuming GMP is installed in /usr/local. It also compiles with dmd -O, but not with gdc.

There is a series of blog posts about this code here:

The file gmp.d is adapted from the one found here:

https://github.com/zergtmn/d-bindings/tree/master/gmp

The remaining code I hereby release into the public domain.
